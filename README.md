# Scraper API Roblox
This project is a Python-based Gapplication built using Ckinter for scraping data from a specified API. It is designed to allow users to check the validity of an API, input a user ID, and scrape data associated with that user. The data is then saved in a JSON file for future reference. The application also includes features for animating button interactions and provides user-friendly error handling.
